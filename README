PLACIEN
========

Placien is a tool allows you to replace Sapien bitmaps with lightweight placeholders.

For pedantry's sake, it's a GUI wrapper around the Placeholder module provided by HXE. For a bit of lore, it's the prettier and more robust successor to Bbkpify. All Bbkpify features are present here.

APPLYING PLACEHOLDERS
---------------------

First, select your placeholder bitmap. The placeholders should be as tiny as possible, as it will prevent Sapien from running out of memory.

After that, select the directory containing the original bitmaps. All of the ".bitmap" files in this directory will be backed up and replaced with the selected placeholder bitmap.

You can also specify a filter. This will narrow the list of bitmaps down to the ones containing the filter.

For example, specifying "multi" will replace only bitmaps such as "cmt_carbine_multi.bitmap" and "a30_burnt_tree_multi.bitmap".

RESTORING BITMAPS
-----------------

When you apply placeholders, Placien creates a text file which lists the bitmaps that have been backed up and replaced with the selected placeholder.

You can restore the bitmaps by selecting the text file containing the list of bitmaps you want to restore. The text file has a random name, e.g. "8C5603D0-17E0-4593-895E-BFFFE24B10D1.txt"
