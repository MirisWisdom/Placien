This document outlines the instructions for using the Placien GUI.

APPLYING PLACEHOLDERS
---------------------

First, select your placeholder bitmap. The placeholders should be as
tiny as possible, as it will prevent Sapien from running out of memory.

After that, select the directory containing the original bitmaps. All of
the ".bitmap" files in this directory will be backed up and replaced
with the selected placeholder bitmap.

You can also specify a filter. This will narrow the list of bitmaps down
to the ones containing the filter.

For example, specifying "multi" will replace only bitmaps such as
"cmt\_carbine\_multi.bitmap" and "a30\_burnt\_tree\_multi.bitmap".

RESTORING BITMAPS
-----------------

All files with the extension ".bitmap.original" in the provided
directory will be restored to ".bitmap".
