PLACIEN
=======

Placien is a tool allows you to replace Sapien bitmaps with lightweight
placeholders.

For pedantry's sake, it's a GUI wrapper around the Placeholder module
provided by HXE. For a bit of lore, it's the prettier and more robust
successor to Bbkpify. All Bbkpify features are present here.

Features include:

-   specifying a bitmap to use as a placeholder;
-   specifying a target directory containing bitmaps;
-   optionally specifying a filter for bitmaps to handle;
-   specifying the Sapien executable path for easy start-up;

Refer to the USAGE documentation for how to use Placien.
