This document outlines the instructions for using the Placien GUI.

APPLYING PLACEHOLDERS
---------------------

First, select your placeholder bitmap. The placeholders should be as
tiny as possible, as it will prevent Sapien from running out of memory.

After that, select the directory containing the original bitmaps. All of
the ".bitmap" files in this directory will be backed up and replaced
with the selected placeholder bitmap.

You can also specify a filter. This will narrow the list of bitmaps down
to the ones containing the filter.

For example, specifying "multi" will replace only bitmaps such as
"cmt\_carbine\_multi.bitmap" and "a30\_burnt\_tree\_multi.bitmap".

RESTORING BITMAPS
-----------------

When you apply placeholders, Placien creates a text file which lists the
bitmaps that have been backed up and replaced with the selected
placeholder.

You can restore the bitmaps by selecting the text file containing the
list of bitmaps you want to restore. The text file has a random name,
e.g.Â "8C5603D0-17E0-4593-895E-BFFFE24B10D1.txt"
